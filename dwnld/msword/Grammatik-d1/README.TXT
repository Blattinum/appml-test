         Grammatik IV - Version 2.0 - February 1, 1991

This file contains the latest information about Grammatik IV.

- Use the MS-DOS "TYPE" or "PRINT" commands to view the contents of
  the file DOCNOTES.TXT. It contains corrections made to the user's
  guide since it was first printed. (You can also read it as an ASCII
  file into your word processor.)

- If you have a Monochrome monitor and a Color card, it may be difficult
  to read Grammatik IV screens. You can solve this by adding "MODE BW80"
  to your AUTOEXEC.BAT file, -OR- by starting any Grammatik IV
  program with the "-m" (for monochrome) switch (e.g., "GMK -m"). You
  can also change screen colors under the "Preferences" menu.
