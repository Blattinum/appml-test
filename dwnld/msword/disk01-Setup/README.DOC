RELEASE INFORMATION FOR WORD 5.5B

Award BIOS and DTK BIOS Machines:

Word 5.5B has keyboard drivers for machines with the Award
BIOS and DTK BIOS. If you are updating from Word 5.5, you
can modify an existing version of Word and choose to update
your video driver. This will create the support that you
need.

ADDITIONAL SETUP INFORMATION

As noted in the "Getting Started" booklet, you need at
least 384K of available RAM to run Word 5.5; 512K is
recommended.  If you are running Terminate-And-Stay-
Resident (TSR) utilities or network software, you should
verify that you have 384K of RAM available after they are
loaded.

Setup will not recognize a directory name longer than 8
characters that has been created with the Novell FILER
utility. If you want to install Word in such a directory,
you can use the following procedure:

1. Run Setup to install Word on the network file
   server, Setup User to install Word on a network
   workstation, in a directory with a name of 8
   characters or less.
2. After Setup has installed Word, use the DOS COPY
   command to copy all of the Word program files
   to the directory you created with the FILER utility.
3. Delete all of the Word program files from the
   original directory specified in step 1. Note
   that Setup makes some of the Word program files
   read-only. You should use the RDWRITE utility to
   make these files read-write before you try to
   delete them.
4. If you ran Setup User, delete the MW.INI file
   from the user directory on the workstation.
5. If you ran Setup User, edit the SET MSWNET55
   statement in the workstation AUTOEXEC.BAT file
   so that it points to the correct user directory
   on the workstation.
6. Start Word, use the /n switch.

If you have an 8514 monitor and use a mouse driver other
than an 8514 mouse driver, you must edit your CONFIG.SYS
file after you run Setup and before you start Word. Word
requires that the line DEVICE = EGA.SYS precede the line
DEVICE = MOUS8514.SYS. Use a text editor such as EDLIN to
make the change. Then restart your system before you
start Word.

Setup and Vega EGA with ROM 1.03 or 1.04:

If you have the Vega EGA card, with BIOS versions 1.03 or
1.04, you must run another program to initialize setup to
run on your configuration. If you do not do this, Setup
won't run.

 To initialize setup:

 1. Make a copy of your Setup disk.
 2. If you are using low-density 360K disks, delete the
    files that begin with g, h, i, and t from the copy of
    the Setup disk.
 3. If you are using low-density 360K or 720K disks, copy
    the files VPA.CMD and WDBF.EXE from the Thesaurus
    disk to your copy of the Setup disk.
 4. Type "vpa setup.exe" and press Enter.
 5. Use the DOS LABEL command and label this disk SETUP_55B
    Now Setup is ready to run.
 6. To install word, type "setup".

Setup and OS/2 DUAL BOOT Systems:

If you are running in protect mode under OS/2 on a DUAL BOOT
system, don't choose to update your mouse driver. If you
want to update your mouse driver, you need to reboot and run
DOS. From DOS, you can run Setup, and choose to modify an
existing version of Word.   From there, you can choose to
update your mouse driver.


ADDITIONAL STYLE SHEET INFORMATION

To apply a style with a key code, you can press either
CTRL+SHIFT and the key code or CTRL+Y and the key code.


INSTALLING WORD TO RUN UNDER WINDOWS 3.0

Setup automatically copies the file WORD.PIF to your Word
program directory. You should use this file to run Word
under Windows 3.0.

To install Word and Learning Microsoft Word under
Windows 3.0:

1. Run the Word Setup program to install
   Word 5.5 on your system.
2. Start Windows 3.0.
3. Open the Program Manager.
4. Open the Program Group from which you want
   to start Word 5.5.
5. Choose File New and select Program Item.
6. In the Description box, type
   "Microsoft Word 5.5"
7. In the Command Line box, type
   "c:\word\word.pif", where "c:\word"
   is the name of your Word program directory.
8. Choose OK

Follow the same procedure to create a Program Item for
Learning Word. In step 7, however, type
"c:\word\learn.pif", where "c:\word" is the
name of your Word program directory.

Note that you can run Windows 3.0 in three modes--
standard mode, real mode, or enhanced (protect) mode.
You can use the Windows Clipboard with Word only if you
are running in enhanced mode. For more information, see
your Windows 3.0 documentation.

You should use the PIF file provided with Word. If you
run Word under Windows 3.0 and notice that the menus
operate very slowly, you probably have the wrong PIF file
settings. For the correct PIF settings, use the PIF file
editor to review the PIF file provided with Word.

USING WORD UNDER WINDOWS 3.0 WITH A HERCULES ADAPTER

When you press CTRL+ESC or ALT+TAB to leave Word under
Windows 3.0, you may see some unexpected characters on
your monitor.

To restore the screen, press CTRL+SHIFT+\.

If you are running Word in a graphics mode with a
Hercules compatible adapter, you cannot leave Word under
Windows by pressing CTRL+ESCAPE or ALT+TAB. You must
choose File Exit to quit Word.


INSTALLING WORD TO RUN UNDER WINDOWS 2.1

If you run Word under Windows 2.1, you should delete
WORD.PIF from your Word program directory after you
install Word. Copy the file WORD.PI2 from the Program
disk 1 to your Word program directory. Rename this file
WORD.PIF and use it to start Word under Windows 2.1.

To start the Learning Word program under Windows 2.1,
delete the file LEARN.PIF from your Word program
directory after you install Word. Copy the file LEARN.PI2
from the Learning Word disk 1 to your Word program
directory. Rename this file LEARN.PIF and use it to start
the Learning Word program under Windows 2.1.


USING THE WORD 5.5 MOUSE DRIVER

You should install the mouse driver supplied with Word
5.5 on your system, even if you have already installed a
mouse driver. The new mouse driver will work with
existing software, including Windows 3.0. If you use a
mouse that isn't compatible with the Microsoft Mouse,
contact the manufacturer for the latest mouse driver.


RUNNING WORD ON A FLOPPY DISK SYSTEM

If you run Word on a dual-floppy disk system and Word
prompts you to insert the disk that contains the file
MW.HLP, you should remove your document disk and insert
your Help disk in the drive that contained your document
disk (usually drive B).

ADDITIONAL MACRO INFORMATION

In addition to the reserved variables described in
Chapter 22, "Macros," in "Using Microsoft Word," you can
use the following reserved variables in written macros:

currentdir: The name of the current directory. TYPE: text
string. SET: no.

startupdir: The name of the directory from which you
started Word. TYPE: text string. SET: no.

programdir: The name of the directory where you installed
Word. TYPE: text string. SET: no.

dialogtitle: The text that appears in the title bar of
the current dialog box. TYPE: text string. SET: no.

You can now set the value of the reserved variable
"scrap." For example, you could include the following
instruction in a macro:
<<SET scrap = currentdir>>

Note that you cannot set the contents of the scrap if it
contains a style.

The reserved variable "scrap" returns the first 255
characters of the contents of the scrap. If the scrap
contains more than 255 characters, the value stored in
the reserved variable is truncated to 255 characters.

In addition, "scrap" can contain only text from a
document, and it cannot retain the formatting of text in
the scrap. The "scrap" variable cannot return the
contents of the style sheet scrap.

In Word 5.5, an autoexec macro will not run automatically
after you choose File Close All, even though Word reloads
NORMAL.GLY after it closes all open files. This prevents
Word from running an autoexec macro whenever you close
all files at once. You can run an autoexec macro at any
time, however, by opening the glossary file that contains
the autoexec macro, choosing Macro Run, and then typing
"autoexec" in the Macro Name box.


USING WORD WITH A MONOCHROME VGA ADAPTER

If you have a VGA adapater and a monochrome monitor, you
may need to use a special video driver. To create the
video driver, first copy and decompress VGA.GS$ and
BASEDOS.KB$ from the Setup disk, and MONOVGA.CS$ from the
Learning disk. For more information about copying and
decompressing files, see the section "Decompressing a
File Manually" in Chapter 5, "Additional Setup Topics,"
in "Getting Started."

To create a new screen driver, see the section "Creating
a Video Driver Without Running Setup" in Chapter 5,
"Additional Setup Topics" in "Getting Started."


USING AN IBM 8514 MONITOR UNDER OS/2

Word uses the VGA video driver to support the IBM 8514
monitor in enhanced (protect) mode under OS/2 1.0, 1.1,
and 1.21. If you have an IBM 8514 monitor connected to
your system when you install Word, Setup will suggest
copying support for a VGA video adapter; the IBM 8514
does not appear on the list of available monitors.


USING AN IBM PS/2 MODEL P70 (PORTABLE) DISPLAY
  UNDER OS/2 1.21

If you run Word on an IBM PS/2 Model 70 with the internal
display, you should delete the file SCREEN.VID from your
Word program directory after you install Word. You can
run Word without the video driver, but only 25-line text
mode is available. The print preview feature is not
available. You should also change the color set to LCD in
the View Preferences Colors dialog box. This prevents the
window border from blinking.


If you are running Word on an IBM PS/2 Model P70 Portable
with IBM (not Microsoft) OS/2 1.1, you need to follow
these steps to create a video driver:

1. Change the name of SCREEN.VID on your Word program
   disk or directory to something else.

2. Copy and decompress the following files from
   their respective disks onto the same disk
   or directory:

 - VIOP70.CSD, VGA.CSD, and VGA.GSD from the Setup disk
 - MAKEVID.EXE from Program disk 3

3. Type the following on one line (note capitalization):

MAKEVID SCREEN.VID -Lfr VGA.CSD -Lfp VIOP70.CSD -Lfs
VGA.GSD

4. Move SCREEN.VID to the Word Program disk or directory.


USING WORD WITH KEYB.COM

If you use the DOS utility KEYB.COM to switch between two
country settings for your keyboard, the key combination
CTRL+ALT+F2 does not choose File Open in Word. You can
press CTRL+F12 instead.


USING WORD WITH PRESENTATION MANAGER

When you run Word in a window under Presentation Manager,
you should make sure that the Menus check box of the View
Preferences command is turned on.


MOUSE SUPPORT AND OS/2

There are some limitations for mouse use under OS/2. The
mouse is not available in:

OS/2 1.0, 1.1, 1.21 or 1.3 protect mode when Word is in
graphics mode. In addition, the Mouse lessons of Learning
Word are not available.

OS/2 1.0, 1.1, 1.21 or 1.3 compatibility box with Word in
graphics mode using VGA or the 8514. The mouse is
available for CGA and EGA modes. You can run both the
Mouse and Keyboard lessons of Learning Word.

OS/2 1.0 compatibility box with Word in 50-line text mode
using VGA or the 8514. Mouse support is available in
other text modes.

OS/2 1.0, 1.1, 1.21, 1.3 protect mode with Word in 43-line
text mode on an EGA card and monochrome monitor. Mouse
support is available in other text modes.


USING WORD WITH MICROSOFT BOOKSHELF AND OTHER TSRs

To use Word 5.5 with Microsoft Bookshelf, you must order
the "Bookshelf Word Processor Update Disk" from Microsoft
Customer Service. In the United States, call 1-800-426-
9400.

If you are using the TSR safe option and you want to
cancel an operation such as printing, searching,
replacing, or a running macro, and if pressing ESC does
not work, you should press CTRL+BREAK instead. You may
need to press CTRL+BREAK more than once to cancel the
operation.
