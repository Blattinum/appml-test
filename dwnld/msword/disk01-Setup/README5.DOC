GENERAL INFORMATION

Library Run makes about 50K more memory available to the
program being run if you include the filename extension
when you type the program name after choosing Library Run
(for example, after choosing Library Run, type
COMMAND.COM, including the extension). The total memory
available to the application depends on your particular
system configuration.

The Quit command in a nested macro now returns control to
the "parent" macro.


NOVELL SETUP INFORMATION

Setup will not recognize a directory name longer than 8
characters that has been created with the Novell FILER
utility. If you want to install Word in such a directory,
you can use the following procedure:

1. Run Setup to install Word on the network file
   server, Setup User to install Word on a network
   workstation, in a directory with a name of 8
   characters or less (not including a 3-character
   filename extension).
2. After Setup has installed Word, use the DOS COPY
   command to copy all of the Word program files
   to the directory you created with the FILER utility.
3. Delete all of the Word program files from the
   original directory specified in step 1. Note
   that Setup makes some of the Word program files
   read-only. You should use the RDWRITE utility to
   make these files read-write before you try to
   delete them.
4. If you ran Setup User, delete the MW.INI file
   from the user directory on the workstation.
5. If you ran Setup User, edit the SET MSWNET55
   statement in the workstation AUTOEXEC.BAT file
   so that it points to the correct user directory
   on the workstation.
6. When you start Word, use the /n switch.


INSTALLING WORD TO RUN UNDER WINDOWS 3.0

Setup automatically copies the file WORD.PIF to your Word
program directory. You should use this file to run Word
under Windows 3.0.


To install Word and Learning Word under Windows 3.0:

1. Run the Word Setup program to install
   Word 5.0 on your system.
2. Start Windows 3.0.
3. Open the Program Manager.
4. Open the Program Group from which you want
   to start Word 5.0.
5. Choose File New and select Program Item.
6. In the Description box, type
   "Microsoft Word 5.0"
7. In the Command Line box, type
   "c:\word\word.pif", where "c:\word"
   is the name of your Word program directory.
8. Choose OK

Follow the same procedure to create a Program Item for
Learning Word. (To order the Learning Word program for
Word 5.0, send in the coupon that came in your Word
package.) In step 7, however, type "c:\word\learn.pif",
where "c:\word" is the name of your Word program
directory.

Note that you can run Windows 3.0 in three modes--
standard mode, real mode, or enhanced (protect) mode.
You can use the Windows Clipboard with Word only if you
are running in enhanced mode. For more information, see
your Windows 3.0 documentation.


USING WORD UNDER WINDOWS 3.0 WITH A HERCULES ADAPTER

When you press CTRL+ESC or ALT+TAB to leave Word under
Windows 3.0, you may see some unexpected characters on
your monitor.

To restore the screen, press CTRL+SHIFT+\.

If you are running Word in a graphics mode with a
Hercules compatible adapter, you cannot leave Word under
Windows by pressing CTRL+ESCAPE or ALT+TAB. You must
choose File Exit to quit Word.


INSTALLING WORD TO RUN UNDER WINDOWS 2.1

If you run Word under Windows 2.1, you should delete
WORD.PIF from your Word program directory after you
install Word. Copy the file WORD.PI2 from the Program
disk 1 to your Word program directory. Rename this file
WORD.PIF and use it to start Word under Windows 2.1.

To start the Learning Word program under Windows 2.1,
delete the file LEARN.PIF from your Word program
directory after you install Word. Copy the file LEARN.PI2
from the Learning Word disk 1 to your Word program
directory. Rename this file LEARN.PIF and use it to start
the Learning Word program under Windows 2.1.


SPELLER TIPS

You can significantly improve the performance of the
spelling checker by choosing Spell Options and selecting
Manual in the "alternatives" field and No in the "check
punctuation" field.

GRAPHICS AND LAYOUT FEATURES

When importing a graphic into footnote text, always
insert an empty paragraph by pressing ENTER before
choosing Library Link Graphics.

It is not possible to import graphics directly from the
Presentation Manager Clipboard.

For a list of graphics packages and scanners you can use
with Word 5.0, see Chapter 20, "Layout Features for
Graphics and Text" in the Word 5.5 version of "Using
Microsoft Word."

HANGING INDENTS AND BORDERS

Paragraph borders are printed at the paragraph indent
position. The text for a bordered paragraph is printed
inside the border instead of at the indent. For a single,
double, or bold border, text prints 0.1" from the indent;
for a thick border it prints 0.2" from the indent.

For bulleted lists within borders, it's best to apply the
border, and then press ALT+T to format bulleted
paragraphs. Word automatically calculates the first line
and left paragraph indents so that they work with the tab
position you jump to after typing a bullet or dash.

If you don't apply the border first, the tab and indents
for bulleted paragraphs are misaligned, with the tab
positioned as set and the indents offset to accommodate
the border. To correct these paragraphs or those that
have been loaded from a Word 4.0 document, remove the
hanging indent format, and then press ALT+T to re-apply
it.


MACROS

For a description of supplied macros added since the
publication of Word 5.0 documentation, see the entry
1-README-FIRST in MACRO.GLY, and Chapter 24, "Macros," in
the Word 5.5 version of "Using Microsoft Word."


SPECIFYING WHERE NEW PAGE FORMATS BEGIN

When a division includes footnotes or annotations, the
next division always starts on a new page, even when you
have selected Continuous in the "division break" field of
the Format Division Layout command. Normally, this option
starts the second division on the same page as the end of
the first division.


MISCELLANEOUS FEATURES

"Use as default" field in Format Divisions Margins: Word
4.0 documents saved with default margin and page size
values (as set for the U.S. version of Word) assume the
default margin and page size values you have selected in
Word 5.0.

EXPANDING RULER

On your screen, Word displays text as if it is formatted
in a 12-point (10-pitch) fixed-pitch font. If you format
text in a different point size, or if you use
proportional fonts, the ruler normally will not correctly
represent the number of characters that will print per
inch.

If you use different point sizes or proportional fonts
and you need to see how many characters will print per
inch, you can "expand" the ruler by selecting Yes in
either the "show line breaks" or "show layout" field of
the Options command.

When one of these options is set to Yes, Word expands the
ruler when it finds a fixed-pitch font smaller than 12
points or if it detects a proportional font that prints
at more than 10 characters per inch. Because Word looks
at more text than is displayed on screen, the ruler may
expand even if the text formatted in a small or
proportional font is not currently visible.

Once the ruler has expanded, it does not contract until
you turn off the show layout and show line breaks
options.

To turn off the show layout and show line breaks options:

- Choose Options, and in the "show layout" and
  "show line breaks" fields, select No.

You also can press ALT+F4 to toggle show layout mode on
and off and press ALT+F7 to toggle show line breaks on
and off.


TSRs AND 3270 EMULATORS

If you run Word with a TSR (a terminate and stay resident
program), including the 3270 emulation control programs
used with 3270 emulation boards like the IBM 3270 board,
IRMA, IRMA2, Attachmate 3270 board, Forte board, or
others, and if you notice undesirable keyboard behavior,
try using the "BIOS-safe" keyboard driver. This should
make the combination of Word and TSRs safer to use. The
side effect is that some key combinations used by Word
may not work directly. These keys can still be accessed
via keyboard macros available in the glossary file
SAFEKEYB.GLY. The affected keys are:
-  ALT+CTRL+ENTER to insert a column break. Press
   CTRL+C+B instead.
-  CTRL+Plus Sign to expand outlining levels up to a
   certain level. Press CTRL+E+O instead.
-  CTRL+5, or CTRL+5 on the numeric keypad, as a prefix
   before pressing the Left or Right Arrow key to jump
   among objects or columns in show layout. Press
   CTRL+J+C instead, followed by the Left or Right
   Arrow key.
-  CTRL+DOWN or CTRL+UP to jump to the next or previous
   paragraph. Press CTRL+N+P or CTRL+P+P instead.
-  CTRL+Period or CTRL+Comma to jump to the next or
   previous field delimited by a closing chevron. Press
   CTRL+N+F or CTRL+P+F instead.

Note that you can re-assign these macros to another
control code or function key combination. For more
information, see Chapter 24, "Macros," in the Word 5.0
version of "Using Microsoft Word."

To install the "safe" keyboard driver:

Rename the file SCREEN.VID in your program directory to
something else, run Setup, and choose the "Modify an
existing version of Word" option. When asked to choose
your machine from the list, select the item "Safe
keyboard support for TSRs, 3270 emulators." Continue
through Setup as usual. You don't need to re-install
printers or the spelling checker.


RUNNING WORD IN A WINDOW UNDER PRESENTATION MANAGER

When running Word in a window under Presentation Manager,
some key combinations may not work directly. These are
described above in the section "TSRs and 3270 Emulators."
To work around this limitation, you can use the glossary
file SAFEKEYB.GLY, which remaps the key combinations to
keyboard macros. This limitation doesn't exist if you run
Word as a full-screen application.


WORD AND MICROSOFT BOOKSHELF

To use Word 5.0 with Microsoft Bookshelf, you must order
the "Bookshelf Word Processor Update Disk" from Microsoft
Customer Service. In the United States, call 1-800-946-
9400.

You must run Word 5.0 in text mode to access Bookshelf.

You cannot paste directly from Bookshelf into Word 5.0.
Instead, save the Bookshelf Clipboard to a file, and then
use the Transfer Merge command to bring its contents into
Word. With the next version of Bookshelf it will be
possible to paste directly into Word 5.0.

You cannot make replacements directly from the Bookshelf
spelling checker or thesaurus.


IBM PS/2 MODEL P70 (PORTABLE) GRAPHICS ADAPTER

If you run Word on an IBM PS/2 Model 70 with the internal
display, you should delete the file SCREEN.VID from your
Word program directory after you install Word. You can
run Word without the video driver, but only 25-line text
mode is available. The print preview feature is not
available. To prevent the window border from blinking,
you should choose the Options command, move to the
"colors" field, type "A", and then press ENTER.

If you are running Word on an IBM PS/2 Model P70 Portable
with IBM (not Microsoft) OS/2 1.1, you need to follow
these steps to create a video driver:

1. Change the name of SCREEN.VID on your Word program
   disk or directory to something else.

2. Copy and decompress the following files from
   their respective disks onto the same disk
   or directory:

 - VIOP70.CSD, VGA.CSD, and VGA.GSD from the Setup disk
 - MAKEVID.EXE from Program disk 3

3. Type the following on one line (note capitalization):

MAKEVID SCREEN.VID -Lfr VGA.CSD -Lfp VIOP70.CSD -Lfs
VGA.GSD

4. Move SCREEN.VID to the Word Program disk or directory.


ADDITIONAL VIDEO SUPPORT

New video support may be available from monitor
manufacturers. Contact your monitor manufacturer for more
information.


NEW MOUSE DRIVER

To ensure that your display works correctly with Word and
the mouse, install the new mouse driver provided with
Word. You can do this easily when running Setup. Using an
older mouse driver with Word 5.0 may cause display
problems.


WORD 5.5 UTILITY FILES AND WORD 5.0

All of the sample style sheets have been updated to Word
5.5 format. You can use these style sheets with Word 5.0.
Note that the "Standard" variants in Word 5.0 have become
"Normal" style I.D.'s in Word 5.5. This change does not
affect functionality.


MOUSE SUPPORT AND OS/2

There are some limitations for mouse use under OS/2. The
mouse is not available in:

OS/2 1.21 in a window.

OS/2 1.0, 1.1, or 1.21 protect mode when Word is in
graphics mode. In addition, the Mouse lessons of Learning
Word are not available.

OS/2 1.0, 1.1, or 1.21 compatibility box with Word in
graphics mode using VGA or the 8514. The mouse is
available for CGA and EGA modes. You can run both the
Mouse and Keyboard lessons of Learning Word.

OS/2 1.0 compatibility box with Word in 50-line text mode
using VGA or the 8514. Mouse support is available in
other text modes.

OS/2 1.0, 1.1, or 1.21 protect mode with Word in 43-line
text mode on an EGA card and monochrome monitor. Mouse
support is available in other text modes.
