ADDITIONAL SUPPORT FOR THE HEWLETT-PACKARD LASERJET SERIES

All PRD files for the Hewlett-Packard LaserJet series now
include support for the IIIP and IIISi models. In addition,
some of the PRD files listed in the Hewlett-Packard section
of "Printer Information for Microsoft Word" have been
changed.

When you install any PRD file for an HP LaserJet, Setup
automatically creates a file with the same name as the PRD
file, but with an .INI extension. You need this INI file
only if you use the IIISi model. If you copy an HP PRD file
manually and intend to use the IIISi model, make sure you
copy the HP3SI.INI file as well. (HP3SI.INI is on the
Utilities/Printer disk if you have 1.2M high-density disks.
It is on the Learning 1 and Print 2 disk if you have 360K
disks and on the Print & Learn disk if you have 720K disks.)
Then rename the INI file to match the name of the PRD file
you want to use. For example, if you copy HPLASMS.PRD,
you should also copy HP3SI.INI and then rename it
HPLASMS.INI.


LaserJet IIISi

Because this is a network printer, you should download all
fonts each time you print.

To use the PostScript option for this printer, choose File
Printer Setup and in the Printer File option, select
POSTSCRP.PRD. In the Printer Name option, select LaserJet
IIISi.
